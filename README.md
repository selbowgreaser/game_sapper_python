# game_sapper_python
Implementation of the game sapper in Python using OOP. 

Interaction with the user occurs through the command line, the state of the field after each step is displayed in the console, the user makes a move using the commands of the triples [X, Y, Action], where X and Y are the coordinates of the cell on the field, and Action is action to be performed: F - place a flag on the corresponding cell, marking it as presumably containing a bomb; O - to reveal the contents of the cell. 
The choice is given to create a field of standard or arbitrary size with a given number of bombs. The game also supports saving and loading games.
